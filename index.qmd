# Backlog of ideas
- Does writing with chatGPT increase or decrease the amount of information you can get when measuring psychological traits.
- What are some potential good consequences of chatGPT being like a person but not being a person.
  - Are you less or more defensive when getting feedback from chatGPT?
- Does interacting with a chatbot make you less careful at work?
- Do we improve on our personal qualities paper by modelling judge fixed effects, or judge fatigue, or time of day?
- Does GPT perform better at pairwise comparison than 1/5 rating?
- The overreliance problem... How much should I read the code given by chatGPT and try to learn from it, vs. how much should I delegate. Just be quicker. There is a tradeoff between learning and speed. I can see some cases where this leads to a hyperbolic discounting problem.
